                        <p>Before the time of what we would now think of upon hearing the word “computer,” this was a
                            title given to those whose job it was to perform calculations. In the late nineteenth
                            century, the Harvard College Observatory began employing women as “computers” to carefully
                            study and compare their collection of glass plate photographs of the night sky.
                            <sup>[1]</sup>
                            The Star Notes project is part of an initiative by Harvard’s Wolbach Library
                            called Project PHaEDRA—Preserving Harvard’s Early Data and Research in Astronomy. Detailed
                            observations about the plates were recorded by the Women Computers in over 2,500 logbooks,
                            and those logbooks have now been scanned in as digital images. The citizen science project
                            is an effort to link those handwritten observations to the archive of over 500,000 plates.
                            This will greatly enhance the accessibility of the photographs, which constitutes a century
                            of astronomical observations. <sup>[2]</sup></p><br>

                        <h1>Task</h1>
                        <p>The task for participants of this citizen science project is simple: locate the references to
                            the photographic plates on the pages of the logbooks and transcribe them in connection with
                            the digital pages. Sometimes it’s as easy as scanning a page for where one of the
                            astronomers has written a label of “Plate ####,” but other times the plate numbers are
                            incomplete, not labeled or otherwise obscured. Due to this and the complexity of the varied
                            styles of handwriting, people are better suited for this task than (machine) computers.</p>
                        <p>Typically, the plate number consists of one or two letters, followed by a series of four to
                            five numbers. Since the numbers are sequential, it isn’t uncommon for long lists of plate
                            numbers to simplify down to just the changed digit (e.g. the list begins with MC1000 and the
                            next line is labeled simply “1” to represent plate MC1001, “2” for plate MC1002 and so on).
                            When making classifications, you’re encouraged to infer and enter the full plate number in
                            that manner if you’re able to, and if you’re not there’s a discussion forum where you can
                            ask for help from others.</p>
                        <p>Each time you’re presented with a new page, you’re asked to click “yes” or “no” for whether
                            the page contains plate numbers. Afterward, you use your cursor to draw a box around each of
                            the plate numbers and submit, then move on to the next page and start again.</p>
                        <p>I’ve included an animated image that I created of one of my classifications below:</p>

                    <div id="content-3">
                        <h1>Reflection</h1>
                        <p>Initially, I chose to work on this project simply because of the fact that it’s furthering
                            work that was performed solely by women. I was excited to see this representation among the
                            available projects and wasn’t disappointed as I did more research along the way. As a woman
                            currently working in a field dominated by men, it was encouraging to see that such an
                            important task was left in the hands of female astronomers, whether at the time it was
                            viewed that way or not.</p>
                        <p>The task wasn’t very difficult, but there were certainly times that deciphering the
                            handwriting in the logbooks was a bit challenging. Much of the writing appeared to have been
                            done with pencil and has become somewhat faint by this time. I was honestly fascinated by
                            the differences in handwriting, though, and my favorite part was finding pages dated further
                            and further in the past. The earliest date I came across was April 29, 1890:</p>
                            <p><center><img src="img/starnotes17.PNG" class="image"></center></p>
                        <p>My favorite things to find in the logbooks, however, were the little illustrations of stars
                            like the ones below:</p>
                            <p><img src="img/starnotes6.PNG" class="image"></p>
                            <p><img src="img/starnotes7.PNG" class="image"></p>

                    <div id="content-4">
                        <h1>Participation</h1>
                        <p>While my 200 classifications don’t seem like much when compared to the 14,316 currently
                            listed on the project’s website (<a
                                href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/projectphaedra/star-notes">Star Notes</a>),
                            I’m glad to have been able to make at least a
                            small contribution to the effort to make the data more accessible. The existence of citizen
                            science projects enables research to be undertaken that might not be without them. According
                            to the Zooniverse website, “the major challenge of 21st century research is dealing with the
                            flood of information we can now collect about the world around us.” With the help of
                            everyday people in their own homes and on their own time, these research projects are
                            completed more quickly than they would be without this involvement, and the fact that any
                            given piece of data is analyzed by multiple people means that the researchers can rely on
                            the “wisdom of crowds” for accuracy. <sup>[1]</sup></p>
